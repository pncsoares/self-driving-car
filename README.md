# Self-driving Car

A self-driving car that uses neural networks and machine learning to move without colliding with other cars or objects.

Here is an example of the neural network breaking to avoid crashing the car in front üëá

And here is another example of the neural network slowing down (releasing the accelerator) to avoid crashing the car in front üëá

# How to use

Open the url: https://pncsoares.github.io/self-driving-car/src

<s>- [x] Move the car with the arrow keys ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨ÖÔ∏è ]</s>
- [x] Refresh the page and watch the car driving like a Tesla but without colliding to other vehicles or walls üòÜ

‚ö†Ô∏è You'll need to refresh a few times because the neural network is randomized so try to find a generation that will move forward.
