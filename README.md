# Self-driving Car

A self-driving car that uses neural networks and machine learning to move without colliding with other cars or objects.

Here is an example of the neural network passing with success all the cars on the road without colliding ðŸ‘‡

# How to 

## Try

1. Open the url: https://pncsoares.github.io/self-driving-car/src
1. Watch the car driving like a Tesla but without colliding to other vehicles or walls ðŸ˜†

## Create better mutations

1. Click the save button when you see a **_good car_*** so the next generation inherit it's brain and mutate to the next generations
1. Refresh the tab
1. Redo this steps as many as you want ðŸ’ª

> **_good car_** : the one that avoids more traffic and reaches the farthest distance

ðŸ§  The more times you run, the better the AI becomes!
