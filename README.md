# Self-driving Car

A self-driving car that uses neural networks and machine learning to move without colliding with other cars or objects.

Here is an example of the neural network passing with success all the cars on the road without colliding üëá

# How to use

Open the url: https://pncsoares.github.io/self-driving-car/src

- Watch the car driving like a Tesla but without colliding to other vehicles or walls üòÜ

‚ö†Ô∏è When you see a good car:
1. Click the save button so the next generation inherit it's brain and mutate to the next generations
2. Refresh the tab
